### Idea
Encrl is a tool programmed by [Pablo Corbal√°n](https://github.com/pblcc) that was created with the intention of learning to use the Golang programming language.

Encrl is presented as a CLI *Console Line App* format.

Encrl is an **encryption and decryption tool based on hash tables**. We are working on all the ciphers for encrl but you can see the current ones in [the codificaions folder](/codifications/).

If you want to add a cipher to Encrl, you can! Remember that the ciphers are represented in a json file as:
```
{
  "a": "codification of a",
  "b": "codification of b",
  ...
}
```
As I have said before this is my first real project in Golang, so I appreciate any input or advice!

### Usage
###### Basic usage:
```shell
./encrl -r reading-file -w writing-file
```
###### Options:
```
-c <cipher>: The  cipher to use
```

---

### Compiling from source
If you want to compile the encrl **from the source code**, You will need:
```
Git v[1.8]+
Golang v[1.12]+
```
Follow this steps:
###### Open a terminal / cmd
###### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/pblcc/encrl.git
```
###### Get inside the repository source code
```
cd encrl/encrl
```
###### Build the code using Go
```
go build
```
###### Use the executable
